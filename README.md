# React Classwork & Assignments – Baitussalam PSDC

This repository contains my ongoing classwork, exercises, and assignments from the React course at Baitussalam PSDC.  
I am regularly updating this repo as the course progresses.

- Today's assignment is to enhance the Todo app by adding edit functionality so users can update their tasks, and to show a line-through effect on a task when it's marked as complete.
